**Expert-backed advice for Information System design, down to .NET and C# implementation**

## What is this book about?
This book will help you create applications that integrate correctly into complex and ever-changing information systems. Youâ€™ll execute this by using industry standards that reduce the app's technical debt and elevate software development practices.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Comprehend the main problems in real-world software development
* Understand what business alignment means
* Create a four-layer map of an information system
* Become proficient in SOLID, C4, and domain-driven design (DDD) architecture
* Get up to speed with semantics, API, and standards for better interoperability
* Include BPM, MDM, and BRMS in information systems
* Design an application with strict responsibility separation

}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for software architects who want to have an in-depth understanding of how their applications will be used and how they can fight technical debt as well as design software to keep it working even when business requirements evolve. If your previous software designs experienced progressive loss of performance and the capacity to evolve, this book is for you.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book.
